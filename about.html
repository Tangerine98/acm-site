                  ACM FISAT Student Chapter is an official student body incepted in 2016 under the patronage of Computer Science And Engineering department, FISAT. ACM FISAT student chapter is a propitious technical chapter in FISAT, which was founded to build a computing fraternity that aims at sharing technical knowledge among students and allowing them to learn, teach and share their knowledge amongst others, making technology more accessible to everyone.<br><br>

                  Since its inception in 2016, the chapter has been engaging the student community with various technical and practical sessions aimed at imparting knowledge to enhance their technical skills. In March 2017, ACM Student Chapter FISAT conducted Celestia, an inter-collegiate quiz competition which has been conducted every year since. Similarly, in December 2017, the 2<sup>nd</sup> year students of ACM Student Chapter FISAT conducted Hour of Code, an initiative to give an introduction to the world of computer science and coding to Highschool students ,hoping to inspire them and to mould future visionaries. This event is also being conducted by 2<sup>nd</sup> year students every year since. Other than these two main events, ACM Student Chapter FISAT has also organized numerous other activities aimed at improving the technical skills of the students.<br><br>

                  Even though ACM Student Chapter FISAT is in its initial years of inception, the chapter is continuing to expand at a rapid rate with more members and activities each year. With the immense  support  given by  our beloved students and staff ACM Student Chapter FISAT will continue to provide technical and practical knowledge to students exposing them to competitive computing world as well as allow them to understand the advancement going on in the computing sector worldwide.
