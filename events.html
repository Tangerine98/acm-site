The welcome speech was delivered by Merlin Mariam Moncy, second year CS student, FISAT.</p>
                                <p class="content-text content">The session began with an introduction to Scratch, a visual programming language and the one hour class was handled by Visrutha Arundhathi R & Maria Sajan, second year CS students , FISAT. About 10 ACM volunteers co-ordinated the whole session .The students were given the opportunity to workout the whole new things taught in their systems and they were given goodies & stickers for motivation. The section came to an end by 11.30 am .Staff co-ordinator ,Ms.Sruthy Suresh concluded the session after the distribution of certificates to the students who attended the session. The whole event was a grand success and the very motive of the event, the hour of code, to spread knowledge in Computer Science ,was clearly met by this event , on behalf of ACM.</p>

                                <p class="content-text content">Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to progressively improve their performance on a specific task. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model of sample data, known as &quot;training data&quot;, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.To update the young minds with new technologies, the ACM FISAT hosted a tech talk by Dr Shihabudheen K.V who is working as an Assistant professor, Department of Electrical &amp;Electronics, TKM College of Engineering, Kollam. The talk was held on September 11, 2018 at the conference hall from 10 am to 12.00 pm. The tech talk was inaugurated by the Computer Science and Engineering HOD. The class dealt with introduction to machine learning, it's applications and various algorithms. Indeed it was a worth session for all.</p>

The workshop's aim was to create a understanding about android development and provide a hands on experience for the students. There were 24 of students all from CSE dept, FISAT. The class were divided into two sessions. 10-12:30 and 1-4:15 . The first session dealt with the basic theories about data  structures and features of android studio. In the  second session the students were made to make a android application by referring with the course material provided by google. The session ended by 4:10 and the vote of thanks was done by yedhin kizhakkethara  in the presence of our HOD Dr.J.C.Prasad and ACM fisat student chapter staff in charge Mrs.Sruthy. A Momento was presented to Mr.Vishak as a token of our appreciation.</p>

                                <p class="content-text content">ACM, the world&#39;s largest educational and scientific computing society, delivers resources that advance computing as a science and a profession. ACM’s Professional and Student chapters worldwide serve as hubs of activity for ACM members and the computing community at large. They provide seminars, lectures, learning forums and networking opportunities with peers and experts across the computing spectrum. An ACM Student chapter was started by Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering, at FISAT and was inaugurated by Dr. G Santhosh Kumar, Associate Professor, CUSAT on 22nd June 2016. It aims to serve as a gateway to forums, panel discussions, and symposia that further aids student&#39;s professional development.</p>
